# AdventofCode
Advent of Code solutions for several years

The input and test-input files are stored in a folder named data and test in the year folder. The input files are not uploaded as stated by Advent of Code.

The advent of code problem page is linked in the readme.

Python tests are documented in the docstrings of the functions. Files can be tested with the doctest command in the terminal:

```sh
python -m doctest filename.py
```
